## Message List [/netbanking/my/messages?{&size,page}?{&sort,order}]
Resource Message List represents collection of messages in the George personal inbox of the user.
This resource consists of paging attributes and array of *embedded* **Message** type items.

Description of **Message List** resource/type attributes: 

| Level | Attribute name | Type/Enum        | Mand/Opt | Attribute description                                                | Expected values/format   |
|-------|----------------|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1     | pageNumber     | INTEGER          | M        | Page number of returned page, starting from 0 for the first page     |                          |
| 1     | pageCount      | INTEGER          | M        | Total number of pages of defined size                                |                          |
| 1     | nextPage       | INTEGER          | M        | Page number of following page                                        |                          |
| 1     | pageSize       | INTEGER          | M        | Provided or defaulted page size                                      |                          |
| 1     | messages       | ARRAY of MESSAGE | O        | Array of messages in the personal inbox of the user (could be empty) |                          |

+ Parameters
    + size (INTEGER, optional) ... Page size used as URI parameter. There is no predefined size limit. If it is omitted, all records are returned in one large list.
    + page (INTEGER, optional) ... Requested page number used as URI parameter. Page count starts at zero, so 0 is the first page. If size is given without any page, page=0 is assumed as default.
    + sort (TEXT, optional) ... Possible sort fields are: `from`, `date` and `id`. If no sort is given, a random order has to be assumed that can change between calls.
    + order (TEXT, optional) ... Sorting order can be either `asc` or `desc` (case insensitive), with `asc` as default. Sorting multiple fields at the same time is possible by comma-separating the sorting fields and their corresponding sort orders. Sort priorities are left to right, so within the first field it is sorted by the second etc. Missing corresponding order entries are considered to be asc.

+ Parameters
    + size (INTEGER, optional) ... Page size used as URI parameter. There is no predefined size limit. If it is omitted, all records are returned in one large list.
    + page (INTEGER, optional) ... Requested page number used as URI parameter. Page count starts at zero, so 0 is the first page. If size is given without any page, page=0 is assumed as default.
    + sort (TEXT, optional) ... Possible sort fields are: `iban`, `description`, `disposable` and `balance`. If no sort is given, a random order has to be assumed that can change between calls.
    + order (TEXT, optional) ... Sorting order can be either `asc` or `desc` (case insensitive), with `asc` as default. Sorting multiple fields at the same time is possible by comma-separating the sorting fields and their corresponding sort orders. Sort priorities are left to right, so within the first field it is sorted by the second etc. Missing corresponding order entries are considered to be asc.
    + type (TEXT, optional) ... This call delivers all types of accounts by default. It is possible to filter for certain product by using the type URI parameter optional comma-separated list of products. *(Functionality is currently not used in George)*

## Payment List [/netbanking/my/orders/payments?{&size,page}?{&sort,order}?{state}?{channel}]
Resource Payment List represents collection of all payment orders entered by user and not deleted.
This resource consists of paging attributes and array of *embedded* **Payment** type items.

Description of **Payment List** resource/type attributes: 

| Level | Attribute name | Type/Enum        | Mand/Opt | Attribute description                                                | Expected values/format   |
|-------|----------------|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1     | pageNumber     | INTEGER          | M        | Page number of returned page, starting from 0 for the first page     |                          |
| 1     | pageCount      | INTEGER          | M        | Total number of pages of defined size                                |                          |
| 1     | nextPage       | INTEGER          | M        | Page number of following page                                        |                          |
| 1     | pageSize       | INTEGER          | M        | Provided or defaulted page size                                      |                          |
| 1     | orders         | ARRAY of PAYMENT | O        | Array of payment orders entered by the user (could be empty)         |                          |

+ Parameters
    + size (INTEGER, optional) ... Page size used as URI parameter. There is no predefined size limit. If it is omitted, all records are returned in one large list.
    + page (INTEGER, optional) ... Requested page number used as URI parameter. Page count starts at zero, so 0 is the first page. If size is given without any page, page=0 is assumed as default.
    + sort (TEXT, optional) ... Possible sort field is only: `transferDate`. If no sort is given, a random order has to be assumed that can change between calls.
    + order (TEXT, optional) ... Sorting order can be either `asc` or `desc` (case insensitive), with `asc` as default. Sorting multiple fields at the same time is possible by comma-separating the sorting fields and their corresponding sort orders. Sort priorities are left to right, so within the first field it is sorted by the second etc. Missing corresponding order entries are considered to be asc.
    + state (TEXT, optional) ... This call delivers all user payments in all states by default (no state parameter provided). It is possible to filter for certain payments by using the state URI parameter with possible values: created, open, spooled, closed, deleted. *(Functionality is currently not used in George)*
    + channel (TEXT, optional) ... This call delivers all user payments entered via all channels (no channel parameter provided) or entered by user via specific channel (by default `GEORGE` should be used). It is possible to filter for certain payments by using the channel URI parameter with possible values: `GEORGE`, `MOBILE_APP`, `BUSINESS24`. *(Functionality is currently not provided in George AT)*

+ Parameters
    + size (INTEGER, optional) ... Page size used as URI parameter. There is no predefined size limit. If it is omitted, all records are returned in one large list.
    + page (INTEGER, optional) ... Requested page number used as URI parameter. Page count starts at zero, so 0 is the first page. If size is given without any page, page=0 is assumed as default.
    + sort (TEXT, optional) ... Possible sort fields are: `id` and `productCode`. If no sort is given, a random order has to be assumed that can change between calls.
    + order (TEXT, optional) ... Sorting order can be either `asc` or `desc` (case insensitive), with `asc` as default. Sorting multiple fields at the same time is possible by comma-separating the sorting fields and their corresponding sort orders. Sort priorities are left to right, so within the first field it is sorted by the second etc. Missing corresponding order entries are considered to be asc.
    + feature (TEXT, optional) ... Optional (multi-valued) features. It is possible to filter for certain product by using the feature URI parameter optional comma-separated list of features.
    + featureset (TEXT, optional) ... Optional Feature sets are to be used as handy shortcuts for certain set of features. If no feature-set is supplied, `NONE` is assumed as default.
    + platformKey (TEXT, optional) ... Optional PlatformKey. If set, will return image ids for each card if appropriate mappings exist with the same platform key.
    + noCache (TEXT, optional) ... Optional noCache. If set to `true`, will not use any cached values for this request (optional URI parameter, default is `false`).
